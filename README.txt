First, run data_generate.py to generate the data. Since we cannot put the mimic-iii dataset in this project based on agreements, this file could only be used for generating random names.

Next, run train.py to train the model. It will save the model to weights folder.

We then can run test.py to evaluate the leakage.

Graphs in the report can be generated by curve.py.
